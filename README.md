# How to customize the month cell based on the appointment using builder in the Flutter Calendar?

Using the [monthCellBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/monthCellBuilder.html) property of the calendar, you can customise the month cell based on appointments in the Flutter Event Calendar.

For cell customization, you can use the required widget. The Text widget was used to customise the month cell in this example. MonthCellDetails returns information about the cell (date, appointments, visibleDates, bounds). You can use this to obtain the cell's appointment details.
